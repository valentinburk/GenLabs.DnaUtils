# GenLabs.DnaUtils

C# library designed to facilitate the analysis and manipulation of genomic sequences. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with nucleotide sequences, including operations such as finding k-mers, calculating sequence skew, and determining Hamming distances. The library is optimized for performance and ease of use, making it suitable for both research and educational purposes.

# Features

* __Sequence Manipulation:__ Create, mutate, and transform nucleotide sequences.
* __K-mer Analysis:__ Count and find clumping k-mers with support for mismatches and reverse complements.
* __Skew Calculation:__ Compute the skew of sequences to identify regions of interest.
* __Hamming Distance:__ Calculate the Hamming distance between sequences to measure similarity.
* __Pattern Matching:__ Find wobbled patterns within sequences with a specified number of mismatches.
